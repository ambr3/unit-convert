/*
 * Seclusa app service worker — offline-first, zero third-party contact.
 *
 * Copy as-is and bump VERSION when you change anything it lists. That string
 * is the whole cache-invalidation mechanism: the cache is named after it, and a
 * new name means a new cache, and the old one is deleted on activation.
 *
 * Rename CACHE_PREFIX to something unique to this app (e.g. "seclusa-bp-").
 * The Cache API is origin-wide, so a shared prefix lets one app delete another
 * app's shell on activate.
 *
 * Design constraints this file encodes, each of which is a bug otherwise:
 *
 *   - GET only. Intercepting a POST and replaying it from cache is how you turn a
 *     failed write into a silent one.
 *   - Same-origin only. Anything cross-origin passes straight through, so a bug here
 *     can never become a data leak to another origin.
 *   - Bounded by name, and only its own cache. Bare `caches.match()` searches every
 *     cache on the origin, which is how one app ends up serving another app's
 *     offline.html under a URL that looks right.
 *   - Queries are not cacheable unless we made them. See cacheable().
 *   - Shell assets are network-first (like navigations). Cache-first JS/CSS plus
 *     SRI on a fresh index.html is how a deploy bricks returning visitors until
 *     they hard-reload: new hashes, old bytes.
